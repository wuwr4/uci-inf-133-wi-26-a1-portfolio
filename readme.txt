--Readme document for *WANRONG WU*, *wuwr@uci.edu*--

A reminder on academic integrity, as described in the syllabus.

In general, the course staff expects that you will look at code and examples from many online resources as part of the assignments, particularly to resolve syntax and understand frameworks. We expect that you'll use other libraries you find, and will even require it in some assignments. These practices are often critical to the work of developers today. The best developers are adept at interpreting the examples they see, customizing them to their specific situation, and citing their sources so they can find them later. We expect you to do the same.

While learning from examples is encouraged, attempting to pass an existing project or example from the web as your own is not allowed. If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, feel free to ask the course staff!

Talking to classmates about class material, assignment requirements, etc. is a great way to verify ideas and get feedback. But this distinctly does *not* permit attempting to pass off someone else’s code as your own. Talking over ideas and approaches is allowed, but the work that you produce and submit must be your own.


1. How many assignment points do you believe you completed (replace the *'s with your numbers)?

9/10
- 1/1 Readme
- 1/2 Basic HTML content
- 1/1 Basic CSS styling
- 1/1 Advanced feature
- 1/2 Responsive layout
- 1/1 Passes validation checks
- 1/2 Embraces spirit of the assignment


2. What (a) basic features, (b) CSS features, and (c) advanced features did you include in your portfolio?

(a) Basic features
- Images with completed alt attributes 
    - Alt attributes are vague because I used placeholder images
- Headings and paragraph text
- Link to external page (github.com)
- Multiple pages, accessible via navbar
- A footer at the bottom of each page

(b) CSS features
- Padding and margins on most elements
- Bootstrap components (accordions, navbar, cards, buttons, pill badges)
    - Component layout adapts to different screen sizes

(c) Advanced features
- A sticky navbar that's always visible on screen regardless of scrolling
- A contact form with a name, email, and message field


3. Did you ignore any of the warnings or errors presented by the accessibility checker? If so, why does this not seem like an accessibility concern? If it's useful, you can consolidate your thoughts on multiple warnings/errors if the rationale is similar.
- Didn't change <b> tags to <strong> --> the text was bolded as a stylistic choice rather than for semantic emphasis
- Ignored all image and alt text warnings --> the images are temporary placeholders due to time constraints
- Ignored suggestion to include a "dir" attribute --> the text is all in English and never changes direction
- Ignored suggestion to include unicode rtl/ltr marks --> the text is all in English and never changes direction
- Ignored suggestion to mark visual lists --> the list uses arrows in place of bullet points as a stylistic choice, which is difficult to emulate using traditional list elements
- Ignored warnings indicating link text is not meaningful --> the links are the names of the corresponding page in the navbar and can't be more descriptive without cluttering the navbar
- Ignored warnings about improper heading usages --> the headers are used in denote different sections of each page
- Ignored warning about Javascript potentiallycausing seizure inducing screnn flickers --> the JS is used for collapsing and expanding animations only, there is no flickering
- Ignored warning about form submission element --> the form does not collect user data and only serves as a visual of its intended functionality 


4. How long, in hours, did it take you to complete this assignment?
- I worked on this assignment for 5 days with an average of 3 hours each day, so ~15 hours.


5. What online resources did you consult when completing this assignment? (list specific URLs, describe queries to Generative AI, or use of AI-based code completion)
- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components
- https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_navbar.asp
- ChatGPT, for help converting Bootstrap utilities to CSS in order to maintain readability


6. What classmates or other individuals did you consult as part of this assignment? What did you discuss?
- I asked a friend for their feedback on some of my stylistic and layout choices to obtain an outside perspective of my designs.


7. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
- Nope.
